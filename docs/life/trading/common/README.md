**Current Quarterly Earnings**

Earnings Growth is an important factor to look at when buying stocks. Look for stocks with increases in current quarterly earnings of at least 25%.

**Annual Earnings Growth**

In addition to quarterly earnings you want to make sure companies are showing strong long term growth. Look for stocks that have grown their earnings at least 25% or more for the past 3 years.

**New Product, Service, Management or Price High**

Studies of the great stock market winners of the past all had something NEW. Always look for companies with new, game-changing products and services.

**Supply and Demand**

S is for Supply and Demand. As more investors demand a limited supply of shares, a stock's price goes up. Look for heavy-volume accumulation by institutional investors, particularly at buy points.

**Leader or Laggard**

We are always looking to buy leading stocks in leading industry groups. Look for the best of the best - the leaders in strong industries that are showing superior earnings growth and sales.

**Institutional Sponsorship**

Professional investors, like mutual funds and pension funds, account for about 75% of all market activity. Using IBD and Investors.com, you'll learn how to follow the big money.

**Market Direction**
