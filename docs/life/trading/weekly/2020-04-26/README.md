- Apple: It's likely to get affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, but the target earnings are fairly low, so it might be a good idea to buy a small amount if the price declines either due to market movement or pre-earnings panic.
- Amazon: It seems to be in a solid situation. Should the price slightly decline, considering getting some.
- Gaming and Leisure Properties (GLPI): the numbers are probably not going to look good, but, for long term, it would be good to get some for signigicant lower price, possibly after the earnings are reported.
- United Airlines: no action needed.
- Southwestern Energy (SWN): No, thanks.
- Twitter: in general it's hard to say what might happen, but should there be a panic selling before earnings call, it will be worthy to give it a try.
- MGM Resorts (MGM): the target earnings are low, so it's likely that nothing will happen. No action needed.
- Visa: Mastercard had the earnings at $1.78 a few days ago, `1.78 * (285.14B / 285.5) * 2 / (390.54B / 184.9) = 1.68` shows that if Visa doesn't mess it up, it should probably have a $1.68 earnings which is significantly better than the expected \$1.35, so should be able to get some.

### Friday

- PG&E Corp
