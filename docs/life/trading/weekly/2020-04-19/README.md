## Thoughts

Although Netflix had a bad run last Friday, given that Netflix's earnings, compared with other companies, will not fluctuate too much due to COIVD-19, it might still be a good idea to get some(=1) before the earnings call on Tueday.

From the future market, if it keeps the same trend on Monday morning, it might be okay to short the market(=20).

For airline companies, it looks like they are going to fluctuate, but it's unclear how. Maybe should wait until the day before Delta's earnings and see how it goes.

Facebook's new gaming app seems interesting. Maybe give it a bit try(=5).

In general, this week looks like a selling week.

## Some news

This new has nothing to do with what is happening to the market currently.

Instead, it is simply indicating that the U.S. stock market tends to become not as profitable as the past several months for the rest of the year from a historial point of view.

It's making a point that ZM, TDOC and WORK are good for short term trading but will face fierce competition from Microsoft and Google.
